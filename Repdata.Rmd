This is the output file for the processing and creation of results for the Reproducible research course
For further information on the assignment please go to the repo [Readme.md](https://github.com/Paulamg/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/README.md)

```{r code to read data and make it tidy}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE)
activity$date <- as.Date.factor(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
